# Self-Contained-NN

## Python Files

Training logs and accuracy report is attached in the final of the files.

### 4-Layers Convolution Networks

* `01_cifar10_conv.py`: Train and save a conv network with 4 conv layers, which will be used as a feature extractor. The final accuracy is about 79% for 100 epochs.

* `01_cifar10_conv_base.py`: Define a new model with the same conv layers as `01_cifar10_conv.py`, but with new FC layers. The conv layers are fixed and not updated when training, for 100 epochs, the result is also about 79%.

### VGG-11 with 8 Conv Layers

* `02_cifar10_vgg11.py`: The same as `01_cifar10_conv.py`, but use VGG11's conv layers, which have 8 conv layers. When trained 200 epochs, the accuracy is about 83%ã€‚

* `02_cifar10_vgg11_base.py`: The same as `01_cifar10_conv_base.py`, but using the above 8-layer conv networks as feature extractor.

### VGG-16 with 13 Conv Layers

* `03_cifar10_vgg16.py`: The same as `02_cifar10_vgg11.py`, but using VGG-16, which has 13 convolution layers.

* `03_cifar10_vgg16_base.py`: The same as `02_cifar10_vgg11_base.py`, but using VGG-16's conv layers as a feature extractor.

## To Do

- [x] Fixed the Conv Layers as feature extractor.
- [ ] Add self-contained connections.
- [ ] Test some update rules of self-contained layer.
